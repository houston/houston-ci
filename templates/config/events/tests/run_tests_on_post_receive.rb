  #
  #   1. GitHub receives a `git push` and triggers all Web Hooks:
  #      POST /projects/houston/hooks/post_receive.
  #   2. Houston receives this request and fires the
  #      'hooks:project:post_receive' event.
  #   3. Houston creates a TestRun and tells a CI server to build
  #      then corresponding job:
  #      POST /job/houston/buildWithParameters.

  #   4. Houston notifies GitHub that the test run has started:
  #      POST /repos/houston/houston/statuses/:sha
  action "test-run:publish-status-to-github", ["test_run"] do
    test_run.publish_status_to_github
  end

  on "test_run:start" => "test-run:publish-status-to-github"

  #   5. Jenkins checks out the project, runs the tests, and
  #      tells Houston that it is finished:
  #      POST /projects/houston/hooks/post_build.
  #   6. Houston receives the request and fires the
  #      'hooks:post_build' event.
  #   7. Houston updates the TestRun,
  #      fetching additional details from Jenkins:
  #      GET /job/houston/19/testReport/api/json
